# CS506 Final Project
This project will focus on **ICE** (U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement) arrests, detentions, expulsions and removals.

# Project Description
We may also analyze regional trends, such as locations where ICE activity is higher, as well as seeing if we are able to predict the future rise of such activity. 

## Goal(s)
From a general browsing of the yearly trends, we can see a consistent (and disconcerting) increase in all forms of activity throughout the country. The goal of this project is to identify and measure the extent to which specific demographics are disproportionately affected by anti-migrant operations.

If that alone is insufficient in scope, we can analyze regional trends such as locations where ICE activity is higher, as well as seeing if we are able to predict the future rise of such activity. 

With the current discourse and political situation regarding this topic in the United States, we believe it is important to have a strong understanding of the governmentâ€™s actions. With that being said, it is possible that the goals of the project will change through working with the data.

## Data
The datasets we are considering include:
- Official [ICE enforcement and removal statistics](https://www.ice.gov/spotlight/statistics)
- U.S. Government Accountability Office
- Supplemental datasets from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?publisher=ICE)

We will be able to directly download datasets from the ICE website on arrests, detainments, etc., and scrape data from other sources as needed.

### Modeling
So far we are only aware of the clustering method, which could serve to expose demographic biases (if present) as previously mentioned. We plan to consider alternatives as we are exposed to more in lecture.

### Visualization
A visualization our group had in mind were heatmaps of expulsions/detentions by region. We will consider other forms of visualization as we learn throughout the course

## Testing
At our current level of understanding the course content, we are unsure of how to plan testing.
