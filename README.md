# CS506 Final Project
This project will focus on **ICE** (U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement) arrests, detentions, expulsions and removals.

## Use


[https://python-poetry.org/docs/]


### Files

***Check section Make commands -- shortcuts for Poetry commands present***

`pyproject.toml`: This file stores *metadata* (author name, version, description, etc.). Includes a dependency declaration and a configuration for build tools. Meant to be edited by developers.

`poetry.lock`: This file stores the *exact dependency* information and guarantee a deterministic, reproducible environment for colloborators. It is automatically generated by poetry.

### Makefile

You *could* run the poetry commands (documented in the following section) by themselves but `Layne` added Makefile commands to make it easier .

```bash
make install # install dependencies for the project

make clean # clean environment

make activate # activate the development environment

make help # to see all available targets

```

### Poetry commands


```bash
# make sure poetry is installed (check documentation above)

poetry install # will install dependencies specified by pyproject and poetry.lock

poetry add <package-name> # will add <package-name> to list of dependencies in poetry.lock :)

poetry remove <package-name> # remove a dependency

poetry shell # how to activate and work within the developer environment

# There are options to create sub groups within environments but that is overly complicated for our purposes.

```

The general order of commands is as follows:

`poetry install` (after freshly cloning the repo)

`poetry shell` (to develop within the development environment)

`poetry [add or remove] package-name` (as needed over the course of development)





# Update the following sections:

## Goal(s)
From a general browsing of the yearly trends, we can see a consistent (and disconcerting) increase in all forms of activity throughout the country. The goal of this project is to identify and measure the extent to which specific demographics are disproportionately affected by anti-migrant operations.

If that alone is insufficient in scope, we can analyze regional trends such as locations where ICE activity is higher, as well as seeing if we are able to predict the future rise of such activity.

With the current discourse and political situation regarding this topic in the United States, we believe it is important to have a strong understanding of the governmentâ€™s actions. With that being said, it is possible that the goals of the project will change through working with the data.

## Data
The datasets we are considering include:
- Official [ICE enforcement and removal statistics](https://www.ice.gov/spotlight/statistics)
- U.S. Government Accountability Office
- Supplemental datasets from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?publisher=ICE)

We will be able to directly download datasets from the ICE website on arrests, detainments, etc., and scrape data from other sources as needed.

### Modeling
So far we are only aware of the clustering method, which could serve to expose demographic biases (if present) as previously mentioned. We plan to consider alternatives as we are exposed to more in lecture.

### Visualization
A visualization our group had in mind were heatmaps of expulsions/detentions by region. We will consider other forms of visualization as we learn throughout the course

## Testing
At our current level of understanding the course content, we are unsure of how to plan testing.
